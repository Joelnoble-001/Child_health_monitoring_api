Child Health Monitoring API

A Django REST Framework API that helps track childrenâ€™s health information, including personal details, health records, and vaccination history.
This project is being developed as part of my Backend Engineering Capstone Project.

ðŸ“– Project Overview

Many children in low-income communities lack access to proper health tracking. Parents and healthcare providers often struggle with keeping up-to-date records, leading to missed vaccinations and unnoticed growth issues.

This API aims to provide:

A way to register children and link them to guardians

Health records (height, weight, notes) for growth monitoring

Vaccination tracking with status updates

A base system that can later integrate with mobile or web apps
